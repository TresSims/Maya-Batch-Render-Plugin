 Maya-Batch-Render-Plugin <br />

My own custom plugin for Batch rendering in maya. <br />


Just an exercise in creating configurable plugins in maya.

Goals:

~~Register scipt as plugin. (and deregister)~~<br />
~~Register New Command in maya for rendering a sequence~~<br />
~~Use project directory for file outputs~~<br />
Create Option Box to Custom configure settings<br />
> Set Frame Range<br />
> Set File Export Type<br />
> Set Export location<br />

Register menu options for easy access


Installation:

To install this plugin drop the MayaBatchRenderPlugin.py in your Maya Plugin Directory, something like:
>C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\maya\2017\plug-ins

Then enable it in your maya plugin window, and youre good to go!
